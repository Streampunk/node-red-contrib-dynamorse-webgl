# node-red-contrib-dynamorse-webgl

An experimental set of nodes for IBM's [Node-RED](http://nodered.org) that support media processing using WebGL. This package is a component of Streampunk Media's [dynamorse](https://github.com/Streampunk/node-red-contrib-dynamorse-core#readme) suite.

Thanks to Matthew Shotton and the BBC [VideoContext](https://github.com/bbc/VideoContext) project for much of the WebGL code and the shaders. 

## Installation

First follow the installation instructions for [dynamorse-core](https://github.com/Streampunk/node-red-contrib-dynamorse-core#readme).

This package can be installed from the 'manage palette' option in the Node-RED menu. Alternatively in your Node-RED user directory, typically ~/.node-red, run

    npm install node-red-contrib-dynamorse-webgl
